Base pwm frequency for ARDUINO, with this code we could use steppers!!


31250Hz for Pin 3, 9, 10, 11
62500Hz for Pin 5 and 6

To get a waveform of some other frequency than the base frequency; we divide the base frequency by the factor we want to decrease the frequency of the waveform

Allowed Divisor for pin 3 and 11 are 1, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 1024.
Allowed Divisor for pin 5, 6, 9, and 10 are 1, 8, 64, 256, 1024.
The following code generates the frequency of 30.64 Hz at pin 3 with a 25% duty cycle.
int PWM_Pin = 3; /* give PWM_Pin name to D3 pin */
// Perform initialization inside setup()
void setup()
{
pinMode(PWM_Pin,OUTPUT);  /*declare D3 pin as an output pin */ 
TCCR2B = TCCR2B & B11111000 | B00000111;
 /*set 30.64Hz Frequency */
}
void loop()
{
analogWrite(PWM_Pin,64);
TCCR2B = TCCR2B & B11111000 | B00000111;
}
